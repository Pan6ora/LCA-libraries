## Known projects

**[Brightway2](https://brightway.dev/)**
<br> `Python` ` Conda`

Brightway2 is an open source framework for life cycle assessment (LCA). It doesnâ€™t try to replace software like SimaPro or OpenLCA, but rather to offer new possibilities to those who want to break the limits of conventional LCA.


**[Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser)**
<br> `Python` ` Conda` `Brightway2` `GUI`

The activity browser is an open source software for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that builds on top of the Brightway2 LCA framework.


**[Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise)**
<br> `Python` ` Brightway` ` Ecoinvent` `IAM`

Premise allows users to integrate user-made scenarios in addition (or not) to an IAM scenario. This is useful for example when a user wants to integrate projections for a sector, product or a technology that is not really covered by IAM scenarios.


**[Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst)**
<br> `Python` ` Brightway` ` Ecoinvent`

Wurst is a python package for linking and modifying industrial ecology models, with a focus on sparse matrices in life cycle assessment. Current development focuses on modifying the ecoinvent LCI database with scenario data from various data sources, using Brightway2 as the data backend.


**[carculator](https://github.com/romainsacchi/carculator)**
<br> `Python` `prospective LCA` ` REMIND` ` Brightway`

Prospective environmental and economic life cycle assessment of vehicles made blazing fast. carculator is a fully parameterized Python model developed by the Technology Assessment group of the Paul Scherrer Institut to perform life cycle assessments (LCA) of passenger cars and light-duty vehicles.


**[Lcopt](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt)**
<br> `Python` `parametrised LCA` ` Brightway`

Lcopt is a python module for creating fully parameterised LCA foreground models using a Flask based interactive GUI developed by James Joyce. It integrates directly with BrightWay2, and can export models to SimaPro.


**[lca-algebraic](https://github.com/oie-mines-paristech/lca_algebraic)**
<br> `Python` `parametric inventories` ` Brightway`

This library is a small layer above brightway2, designed for the definition of parametric inventories with fast computation of LCA impacts, suitable for monte-carlo analyis.


**[bw2regional](https://brightway2-regional.readthedocs.io/)**
<br> `Python` `regionalized LCA` ` Brightway`

bw2regional is a separate library that extends the Brightway LCA framework to do regionalized LCA calculations. It is easy to do regionalized LCA incorrectly. This package tries to make it at least a bit easier to do regionalization correctly, for at least some definitions of correct.


**[bw2_aware](https://github.com/cmutel/bw2_aware)**
<br> `Python` `regionalized LCA` ` Brightway`

This package provides the AWARE regionalized LCIA method in brightway and brightway2-regional. Monthly characterization factors are currently not imported.

**[pylcaio](https://github.com/MaximeAgez/pylcaio)**
<br> `Python` `hybridization` `Brightway`

An object class to hybridize lifecycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) databases.
